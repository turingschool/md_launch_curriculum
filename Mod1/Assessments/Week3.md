## Week 3 Assessment

### Setup

<!-- In Github, fork [this repository](https://github.com/memcmahon/Mod1Week3Assessment).  Then in Visual Studio, clone your fork. -->
**Fork** [This REPL](https://replit.com/@RichardTillies2/M1W3-Week3Assessment#Program.cs).

The `Program.cs` file contains some commented code and instructions for **6 exercises**.  Follow the instructions for each exercise; you may do some uncommenting, code additions, code removal, and code creation.  Reach out to your instructor with any questions that you have!

### Submission and Feedback

<!-- When completed, commit the progress you have made, and push your project to GitHub.  Instructors will be following up with some video feedback! -->
When completed, add your instructors as collaborators to your REPLit project and DM them a link to your forked repl.  Instructors will leave feedback on your replit project.

### Rubric

This assessment has a total of **20 Points**.  Earning **10 or more** points is a **pass** and will indicate that you are progressing well with the material.

As a reminder, this assessment is for students and instructors to determine if there are any areas that need additional reinforcement!

<!-- Really like that Exercise 4 included a way for students who couldn't implement it in code to still show their learning/how they handled their issue! -->
<!-- I think that the comments/directions for each exercise are pretty clear. We will see in time whether they are clear enough for students, but I think as long as we always are prioritizing writing clear/explicit instructions, we will usually wind up in a strong starting place! -->
