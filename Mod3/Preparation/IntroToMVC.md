Maybe the preparation is to learn about path parameters and query string parameters?

Reading the intro to MVC feels like a good prep too: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-6.0


Open question: do we introduce path and query string parameters as part of the intro MVC lesson. Do we together follow along through the microsoft docs?



Maybe a you learn lab on validation later in Mod 3?

Question: Do we even want to teach about using ViewData to pass from controller to view? Or just a model?


The lab: Changing certain things within this movies app. For example, adding a new field. What changes in the Model, View, and Controller?

When to talk about the Razor markup syntax? https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-6.0

```C#
<ul>
    @for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        <li>List item @i</li>
    }
</ul>
```
